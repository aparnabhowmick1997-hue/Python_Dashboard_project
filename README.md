we will quickly examine price per square ft. to check minimum, maximum, mean,percentile value.
we can understand by that example,that 500 rs. square ft. which is very very low for the city bangalore , you would be very lucky ,if you can find such as property,so it is an outliers for any customer .same as 12000000 rs. square ft. which is way too high. it seems almost impossible and even if it is legitimate it can help data analysis process if we remove such a data point.It will help customer to analyze  a small and clear data set than over a large data set.
